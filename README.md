#DFS for directed graph

This is an simple implementation for DFS algorithm.
1. Using the recursive
2. Using variable arguments(does not make sense for the algorithm, just for the practise for how to use variable arguments)
3. Including the function:
	3.1 DFS from one vertex
	3.2 Check if there is valid path between 2 vertices
